This is a story about a man named Ron. He was an average man, had a job, had a family of a wife and two kids and played golf on the weekends. He was persistent on doing his best at the workplace he worked. His work was very special, very important and most of all fun. Well if you call just typing keys on the computer that is.

One day, he was ready to do the things he had done for the past five years, type he waited patiently on the list of orders from the boss. an hour had gone by but no orders for kyes came in. He became confused, he started to wonder why he wasn't getting any work in the last hour. "Maybe i just missed a meeting" Ron thought. As he got up from his office chair, from the early 90's, he began his long journey to the meeting rom. 

Luckily the room was just down the corridor. when he opened the doors to the meeting room, with two big squeaking doors, sounding like a bad horror movie from the 80's they swung slowly open. Ron looked in to the meeting room, but strangly, it was empty, no living soul in the room other than Ron. This startled Ron a little bit, but fear couldn't overcome the love for his work, so Ron set of for his biggest adventure yet. Through the Office.
